# CIS Benchmark Security Audit Scripts

I created these scripts to run at the creation of a new server to help me harden the operating system. These are purely audit scripts. You will need to be familiar with the CIS benchmark for the OS or have the document open in front of you.

A couple things to note:
* These scripts contain only the benchmarks that I felt were appropriate for the environment I created them for.
* These are LEVEL ONE benchmarks only.
* If you are running internet facing servers you will need to add more benchmarks. I may create new versions for that purpose.
* These will not remediate the listed check. You will need to do the remediation steps.
* This is NOT a catch-all. You will need to know YOUR environment and how these will impact YOU.
